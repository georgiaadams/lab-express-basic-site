      Born on 8 May 1926 in Isleworth, Middlesex, Sir David Frederick
      Attenborough is an English broadcaster and natural historian. He is best
      known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural
      History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series forming the Life
      collection that together constitute a comprehensive survey of animal and
      plant life on Earth. <br />

      Attenborough's contribution to broadcasting and wildlife film-making has
      brought him international recognition. He has been called "the great
      communicator, the peerless educator"[70] and "the greatest broadcaster of
      our time."[71] His programmes are often cited as an example of what public
      service broadcasting should be, even by critics of the BBC, and have
      influenced a generation of wildlife film-makers.
